The Walrus and the Carpenter
  Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
  Conveniently low:
And all the little Oysters stood
  And waited in a row.

'The time has come,' the walrus said,
  'To talk of many things:
Of shoes - and ships - and sealing-wax -
  Of cabbages - and kings -
And why the sea is boiling hot -
  And whether pigs have wings.'

'But wait a bit,' the oysters cried,
  'Before we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath,
  And all of us are fat!'
'No hurry!' said the Carpenter.
  They thanked him much for that.

'A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said,
  'Is what we chiefly need:
Pepper and vinegar besides
  Are very good indeed -
Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,
  We can begin to feed.'

'But not on us!' the oysters cried,
  Turning a little blue.
'After such kindness, that would be
  A dismal thing to do!'
'The night is fine,' the Walrus said.
  'Do you admire the view?

'It was so kind of you to come!
  And you are very nice!'
The carpenter said nothing but
  'Cut us another slice:
I wish you were not quite so deaf -
  I've had to ask you twice!'

'It seems a shame,' the walrus said,
  'To play them such a trick,
After we've brought them out so far,
  And made them trot so quick!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
  'The butter's spread too thick!'


'O Oysters,' said the Carpenter,
  'You've had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?'
  But answer came there none -
And this was scarely odd, because
  They'd eaten every one.
